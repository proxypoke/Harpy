Overview
--------
Harpy, the _Handy Abstraction of Redis in PYthon_, as the name
implies, is an abstraction around the Redis data structures in Python. The
purpose is to make the usage of Redis (near-)transparent to the developer by
wrapping Redis' data structure into classes which emulate their native Python
counterparts by implementing the same interfaces.

The goal is to provide at least the four data structures which Python already
provides: strings, lists, dictionaries and sets, and be able to use them as
drop-in replacements with as little overhead as possible.
